# Data types in action

# a = 24 # int
# b = 16 # int
# c = 5.5 # float

# Arithmetic
# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a + c) # result is a float

# Boolean values
# print(a > b)
# print(a < b)

# Built in methods for boolean
# greeting = "Hello world!"
# print(greeting.isalpha()) # checks if the variable holds letters
# print(greeting.islower()) # checks if the variable is in lower case
# print(greeting.endswith("!")) # checks if it ends with a "!"
# print(greeting.startswith("H")) # checks if it starts with a "H"

# In SQL, we have seen Null, but in Python, we have None
x = None
print(type(x))
print(x is None)
